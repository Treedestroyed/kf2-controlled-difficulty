# Getting Started

Just want to jump into CD solo?  Here's how:

1. Subscribe to the [Steam Workshop item](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=2050357684).

1. Start KF2.  If KF2 was running when you subscribed, then restart KF2.

1. Open the console.  On US-style keyboards, the backtick/tilde key (\` or ~) opens the console.

1. Type or paste this line into the console:
   ```
   open KF-Outpost?game=ControlledDifficulty_Blackout.CD_Survival
   ```
   You can add options to customize CD.  Options key-value pairs separated from one another by "?" signs.
   For example:
   ```
   open Outpost?game=ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival?CohortSize=8?SpawnPoll=2.0?WaveSizeFakes=2
   ```
